## Multi-Task Learning
- Types of Learning
    - Multi Task Learning - Training on Multiple Tasks
    - Transfer Learning - Caring about one of the multiple tasks specifically.
    - Domain Adapation - Transfer Learning where the task is the same but different topics, like in summarization News, Story or Long Document.
- Rules of Thumb

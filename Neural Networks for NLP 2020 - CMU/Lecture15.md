# Risk, Minimum Risk Training and Reinforcement Learning
- MLE   
    - Predicting next word(action) given previous words (actions)
    - Maximize the likelihood of the prediction
    - (also called teacher forcing)
    - Problems
        - Exposure Bias 
        - Disregard to Evaluation Metrics (We want good outputs)
            - Some predictions are worse than others. 
- Error: Generate an output, calculate its badness, we would like to minimize this error
    - The argmax function makes discrete zero-decisions, therefore it's non-differentiable. 
- Risk: It is the expectation of the error. 
    - This include the probability in the objective function
    - Differentiable but the sum is intractable.
    - Minimum risk training, minimizes risk  (MRT Shen et al 2015)
        - Sample samples and calculate risk over that.
        - Samples using random sampling or n-best search
    - Strong connection between risk and the error function being a zero-one loss.
    - Temperature helps adjust for the small sample.

# Learning Haskell 
I've always wanted to learn functional programming, I've always only coded object oriented programming languages like C++, Java and Python. Although python has functional element to it, its not a pure functional language. 
I think functional programming will add an additional dimension of thought to my programming thinking ( in ways i don't know yet). Its been ages since i picked up a new language. 

## The three books I'm following is 
- Haskell Programming from First Principles
- The Haskell School of expression 
- Programming in Haskell 


## What is Functional Programming ?
- From what I gather, Unlike object oriented programming where in objects of classes are the basic model of computation, Functional programming has functions as the basic model by that i mean functions are applied arguments. 


## Features of Haskell 
- Concise Programs - Haskell has been written in a way that you write programs in as concise a manner as possible. 
- Powerful Type System [?]
- List Comprehensions
- Recursive, Higher Order, Effectful, Generic functions
- Lazy Evaluation
